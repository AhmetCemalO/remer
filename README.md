## Basler‑Arduino Hardware‑Trigger Capture

This project lets a Basler acA640‑120gm GigE camera record only when an
external device asserts a TTL line. (For now)

### Hardware
- **Camera:** Basler acA640‑120gm (GigE)
- **Trigger source:** Arduino Uno outputs 5 V pulses
- **Wiring**
- TODO

- It contains 3 files FirstStepCode is the working basic implementation with keyboard control
- BaslerOlfactometerTriggerCode is the second implementation with line1 TTL trigger control and it is mostly working correctly.
- Camera check is for checking if our device sees the camera or not.
